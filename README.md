**SmartEd**

**Introduction**

In the current era, online education is becoming more and more popular. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) that can facilitate students and instructors to have an efficient learning experience. The proposed application, named SmartEd, will allow individual instructors and educational institutes to create and manage their courses, upload course content, schedule online classes, assignments, and evaluate student progress. Students can search for courses based on their interests, request enrollment in a course, access course material, view their grades, communicate with instructors and peers, and submit assignments.

**Problem Statement**

The lack of a comprehensive online LMS creates a barrier for students and instructors to have a smooth and effective learning experience. The traditional methods of learning are not efficient and cannot keep up with the fast-paced technological advancements. Therefore, there is a need for a web application that can bridge this gap and provide a comprehensive platform for instructors and students to interact and facilitate learning.
